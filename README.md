**RADEC** is a compact, open-source control board designed to drive stepper motors for telescope GoTo systems.



## About The Project
RADEC is an **open-source controller for telescopes**. It's based on the **MEADE LX200** communication protocol which is easy to understand and simple to code.
It communicates with the computer through a **serial port** and reacts in almost **real time**!


## Features

- Compact design (**you can contribute** - go to section)
- **USB-UART** communication
- **I2C LCD** support
- On-board **power management**
- Controlled by every software that support **MEADE LX200** communication protocol
- ~~**WIP** - [**Skynapse**](https://github.com/bertidiego/skynapse), the **open-source** software that controls RADEC to life with precise slewing, object tracking, and PC-based UI (go to section)~~ **Skynapse is being discontinued**, please use **[Stellarium](https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium)** which is a free software that does the same things, except 100 times better :)


## Hardware Components

The main components of RADEC **REV1** are, but not limited to:

- **1x** ATMEGA328P-AU microcontroller
- **1x** LM2596S for the step-down regulator
- **1x** C99652 for USB communication
- **1x** USB Type-B port (**To be upgraded to an USB Type-C**)
- **OPTIONAL** - **1x** LCD I2C **16x4** to display current data
- You can take a look to the BOM down below!
